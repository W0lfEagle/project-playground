#Working directory

This is the project working directory as of a couple of months ago when I first showed the prototype to the language school. 

It is pretty disorganised which is why the version submitted as final project was also included.

This folder includes a lot of code resulting from various experiments

The website served as index was an exercise converting a pure HTML, CSS and PHP site at linguafrancaworld.com to Bootstrap.
